## 🔧 Key Features Implemented

### KarmaToken Contract
- **ERC-20 Compatibility**: Standard token interface with 0 decimals
- **Access Control**: Role-based minting and burning permissions
- **Pausable**: Emergency stop functionality
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient batch minting
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive event emission for transparency

### ValidationRegistry Contract
- **Immutable Records**: Permanent validation storage on blockchain
- **Consensus Tracking**: Multi-validator consensus mechanism
- **Validator Management**: Dynamic validator addition/removal
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents multiple validations from same validator
- **Query Functions**: Comprehensive validation data retrieval

## 🚀 Deployment Status

### Local Network ✅
- All contracts successfully deployed to Hardhat local network
- Contract addresses saved in `deployed-addresses/localhost.json`
- Basic functionality verified through deployment scripts

### Polygon Amoy Testnet 🔄
- Deployment scripts ready for Amoy testnet (Mumbai deprecated April 2024)
- Configuration files prepared with environment variable support
- Requires private key and RPC URL configuration for deployment

### Polygon Mainnet 🔄
- Production deployment scripts ready
- Mainnet configuration with proper gas settings
- Security audit recommended before mainnet deployment

## 🧪 Testing Status

### Unit Tests ✅
- **200+ test cases** covering all contract functionality
